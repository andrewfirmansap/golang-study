# Golang Study Repository
Welcome to the Golang study repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repository contains my practice and study material for learning Golang. The code demonstrates various fundamental concepts and features of the Go programming language.

## Overview

This project is a simple Go program that covers a wide range of basic concepts in Golang. It includes variable declaration, control structures, constants, loops, arrays, slices, and maps. The aim is to showcase my understanding and competency in these areas.

## Features Demonstrated

1. **Variable Declaration and Initialization**: Different ways to declare and initialize variables.
2. **Basic Data Types**: Usage of `int`, `string`, `float32`, and `bool`.
3. **Formatted Printing**: Using `fmt.Printf` for printing variable values and types.
4. **Control Structures**: Implementation of `if-else` conditions.
5. **Constants**: Declaration and usage of constants.
6. **Loops**: Usage of `for` loops for iteration.
7. **Arrays and Slices**: Manipulating arrays and slices.
8. **Maps**: Creating and iterating over maps.
